1. Write a program that creates a map storing words and definitions. Create 
functions for entering words/definitions and displaying a word's definition. 
Be sure to test your functions.

2. Write a quiz program that uses a map to quiz the user on US state capitols. 
The program should ask the user to name the capitol of a given state and display 
the answer and whether or not the user was right or wrong. Have the program generate 
the states randomly. The program should quiz the user until the user says to stop.
