Use an algorithm from the STL for these problems

1. Write a function that checks to see if a value is less than 50. Use the function to find the first value in a vector that is less than 50. Have the function return the position in the vector.
2. Rewrite Problem 1 using an anonymous function rather than a function.
3. Write a function that checks to see if a value is even. Use the function to count the number of even values in a randomly generated vector of integers.
4. Rewrite Problem 3 using an anonymous function.
5. Using the vector from problems 3 and 4, write a program that removes all the odd values from the vector using a predicate function.
6. Rewrite Problem 5 using an anonymous function.

Removing and Replacing Elements

1. Create a vector of words that end in "y" that are made plural by removing the "y" and adding "ies." Write a function that takes a word ending in "y" and makes it a plural by adding "ies." Use the function with the replace() algorithm to change all the words in the vector to plurals.
2. Modify the vector of words ending in "y" in the problem above so that some words don't end in "y." Use the replace_if() function to only make words ending in "y" plural.
3. Create a vector that contains 20 random numbers from 1 to 100. Use the remove() function to remove a value chosen by the user. Make sure the removal is permanent.
4. Write a function that determines if a number is odd. Use the function with the remove_if() function to remove all the odd numbers from a randomly generated vector of numbers.
5. Using an anonymous function, write a program that removes all the numbers between 0 and 49 permanently from a randomly generated vector of numbers.
